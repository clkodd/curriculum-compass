# volunteer-verse

People can add volunteering events, with information like location, hours, volunteer capacity, minimum age, activity level, description, etc. Others, the volunteers, will input the cities they are willing to volunteer in, their age, desired activity level, and other attributes to filter volunteering events in which they can participate. You can view a leaderboard of all the volunteers registered on the site and who has the most hours logged. The volunteer will be able to view a schedule that lists all the events they are registered for at which times. Events will not be shown that conflicts with the volunteer's already registered schedule.
